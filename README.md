# Python snake
An implementation of the classical game Snake in Processing3 for python. 

## Gameplay
The purpose is to get as high of a score as possible. Each green food has a nutrituional value of 1 score, every blue 4 and every red gives 10. The food slowly rots away and is then replaced by new fresh food. The higher the nutritional value of the food, the shorter its shelf life. The snake will grow by one block for each food item consumed regardless of its nutrituional value.

The snake has a very fragile head and will die immediately upon impact with itself, so be careful!
